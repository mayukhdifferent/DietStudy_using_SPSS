Conclusions which can be drawn at 95% CI(using the Sig olumn in SPSS): Since the significance value for change in weight is less than 0.05, we can conclude that the average loss of 8.06 pounds per patient is not due to chance variation, and can be attributed to the diet.

However, the significance value greater than 0.05 for change in triglyceride level shows the diet did not significantly reduce their triglyceride levels.
